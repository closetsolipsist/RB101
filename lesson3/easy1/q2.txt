1. The 'not equal to' operator. It is used between two expressions to check if they objects they refer to have the same value
2. The 'not' operator. It is used before an expression and returns true if the expression is falsy (false or nil) and false if it's truthy
3. By convention, many methods which mutate the calling object have an ! at the end of their name.
4,5 The ternary operator has the syntax [condition] ? [value if condition is true] : [value if condition is false]. If ? is at the end
   of a method name, it (generally) indicates that method returns true or false
6: Just two not operators. Returns true if the expression denotes something truthy and false if it denotes something falsy

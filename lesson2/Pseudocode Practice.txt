Given two integers a and b
Return a + b

START

# Given integers a an db

RETURN a + b

--------------------------------

# Given a collection of strings

Set a variable to the empty string
Iterate through the collection
  Update the saved variable to be concatenated with the current value

# Given a collection strs of strings
SET c = ''
SET iterator = 1
WHILE iterator <= length of strs
  SET c = c concatenated with string at positon "iterator" of strs
  iterator = iterator + 1
PRINT c
END

--------------------------------

# Given a collection of integers

Set a variable to new_array to an empty collection
Iterate through the collection of integers
  append current value to new_array if its index is even

# Given a collection numbers of integers
SET new_array = []
SET iterator = 0
WHILE iterator < length of new_array
  IF iterator is even
    append element at positions "iterator" of numbers to new_array
  SET iterator to iterator + 1
PRINT new_array
END

--------------------------------

# Given string str an character c
set occurrences to 0
set index to 0
Iterate through characters of str
  if current character is c, increment occurrences
  if occurrences is 3, return index
  increment index
return nil

SET index = 0
SET occurrences = 0
WHILE index < length of str
  IF element at position index of str is c
    SET occurrences to occurrences + 1
    IF occurrences is 3
      RETURN index
  SET index to index + 1
PRINT nil
END

--------------------------------

# Given arrays a1 and a2
create a new array merged_array
let i be 0
while i is less than length of a1
  append the ith element of a1 to merged_array
  append the ith element of a2 to merged_array
  increment i
print merged_array

SET merged_array = []
SET i = 0
WHILE i < length of a1
  append a1[i] to merged_array
  append a2[i] to merged_array
  SET i to i + 1
PRINT merged_array
